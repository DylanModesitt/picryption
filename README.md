# picryption
A way to encode images with messages by changing the RGB values of the pixels of the image to be binary based on the even or odd nature of the color. This binary can be read as a string, and similarly any iamge can have a string written into it by tweaking slgihtly the colors of each pixel to match the binary representation of the string to later be read back.
